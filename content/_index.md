        The Shi Photonics Group explores new frontiers in light manipulation using nanophotonics. Our research spans the entire stack — from new physics of nanoscale light–matter interaction, to innovative photonic components with novel optical responses, and fully integrated photonic systems for dynamic light control. A key focus is bridging nanophotonics with active platforms such as MEMS, liquid crystals, and nonlinear materials to enable next-generation programmable light processing. These technologies open new possibilities for applications in both the classical and quantum domains, including advanced imaging, sensing, displays, and emerging quantum computing systems.
